## Resume

For this test, you requested an application using the Github API, where it shows all the user repositories (I chose to use the user reactjs) and when selected, shows the commits.

#### Using

- React
  - React Router - SPA functionality
- Axios - for promise HTTP requests
- CSS
  - Styled Components
- CircleCI
- Firebase

## Installation

We will install this project with Terminal.

First of all, clone the project from the repository:

```
https://github.com/dwolfx/github-gympass.git
```

Enter in project past:

```
cd github-gympass
```

After install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

When the installation is completed, run the project:

```
npm run start
--OR--
yarn start
```

## Considerations

Have some considerations on this test that I need to explain.
I'm not a React programmer, and I was not able to meet the deadline for not being able to study during the week, leaving me only Friday night until Sunday, during which period I did some courses on React to be able to complete the requested test.
I had never used Styled Components before this test, I also had to learn how to use it and so maybe i'm not use best practices.
I could not do the tests as I wanted, so I'm not showing how to run them up in the installation.

The Demo / Preview site is online through CircleCI / Firebase, and when I commit to the master, it automatically updates in production if the tests pass.

I'm a developer focused on design, where I also did a site mockup before I started styling it. (Image in end of this comment)
I really love UI/UX and have knowledge in Adobe Photoshop (Image Editing), Adobe Illustrator (Vector Creation), Adobe XD (Prototype software), Adobe After Effects (Video Editing) , and Adobe Premiere Pro (rendering / video art)

Any questions or problems about my test, please tell me.
I have no problem accepting criticism / errors, they always make me seek to improve more every day.

**Thanks for the opportunity**

Prototype made in the XD to serve as guide in the creation of the project.
I did not spend much time in it, just a guide to help me visualize how it would be in the end
