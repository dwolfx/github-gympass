# Front-End Test for Gympass

#### Basic Overview - [Live Demo](https://gympass-test-dce37.firebaseapp.com/)

## Resume

For this test, you ask for an application using Github API, where show all repositories from user (reactjs) and when selected, show commits.

## Installation

We will install this project with Terminal.

First of all, clone the project from the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/dwolfx/github-gympass.git
```

Enter in project past:

```bash
cd github-gympass
```

After install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

When the instalation is completed, run the project:

```bash
npm run start
--OR--
yarn start
```

## Considerations

Have some considerations on this test that I need to explain.
I'm not a React programmer, and I was not able to meet the deadline for not being able to study during the week, leaving me only Friday night until Sunday, during which period I did some courses on React to be able to complete the requested test.
I had never used Styled Components before this test, I also had to learn how to use it and so maybe i'm not use best practices.
I could not do the tests as I wanted, so I'm not showing how to run them up in the installation.

The Demo / Preview site is online through CircleCI / Firebase, and when I commit to the master, it automatically updates in production if the tests pass.

I'm a developer focused on design, where I also did a site mockup before I started styling it.
I really love UI/UX and have knowledge in Adobe Photoshop (Image Editing), Adobe Illustrator (Vector Creation), Adobe XD (Prototype software), Adobe After Effects (Video Editing) , and Adobe Premiere Pro (rendering / video art)

Any questions or problems about my test, please tell me.
I have no problem accepting criticism / errors, they always make me seek to improve more every day.

Thanks for the opportunity
